/**
 * The SwipeGesture class represents a swiping motion of a finger or tool.
 *
 * <strong>Important: To use swipe gestures in your application, you must enable
 * recognition of the swipe gesture.</strong><br/>You can enable recognition with:
 *
 * <code>leap.controller.enableGesture(Gesture.TYPE_SWIPE);</code>
 *
 * Swipe gestures are continuous.
 *
 * You can set the minimum length and velocity required for a movement to be
 * recognized as a swipe using the config attribute of a connected Controller object.
 * Use the following keys to configure swipe recognition:
 *
 * <table class="innertable">
 *   <tr>
 *    <th>Key string</th>
 *    <th>Value type</th>
 *    <th>Default value</th>
 *    <th>Units</th>
 *  </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Gesture.Swipe.MinLength</td>
 *    <td>float</td>
 *    <td>150</td>
 *    <td>mm</td>
 *  </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Gesture.Swipe.MinVelocity</td>
 *    <td>float</td>
 *    <td>1000</td>
 *    <td>mm/s</td>
 *  </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * The following example demonstrates how to set the swipe configuration parameters:
 *
 * <code>if(controller.config().setFloat(&quot;Gesture.Swipe.MinLength&quot;, 200.0) &amp;&amp;
 *       controller.config().setFloat(&quot;Gesture.Swipe.MinVelocity&quot;, 750))
 *        controller.config().save();</code>
