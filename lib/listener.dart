 * The Listener interface defines a set of callback functions that you can

 *
 * To handle Leap events, implement the Listener interface and assign
 * it to the Controller instance. The Controller calls the relevant Listener
 * callback when an event occurs, passing in a reference to itself.
 * You have to implement callbacks for every method specified in the interface.
 *
 * Note: you have to create an instance of the LeapMotion class and set the Listener to your class:
 *
 * <listing>
 * leap = new LeapMotion();
 * leap.controller.setListener( this );</listing>
