/**
 * The Finger class represents a tracked finger.
 *
 * Fingers are Pointable objects that the Leap Motion has classified as a finger.
 * Get valid Finger objects from a Frame or a Hand object.
 * 
 * Fingers may be permanently associated to a hand. In this case the
 * angular order of the finger IDs will be invariant. As fingers move in
 * and out of view it is possible for the guessed ID of a finger to be
 * incorrect. Consequently, it may be necessary for finger IDs to be
 * exchanged. All tracked properties, such as velocity, will remain
 * continuous in the API. However, quantities that are derived from the
 * API output (such as a history of positions) will be discontinuous
 * unless they have a corresponding ID exchange.
 *
 * Note that Finger objects can be invalid, which means that they do not
 * contain valid tracking data and do not correspond to a physical finger.
 * Invalid Finger objects can be the result of asking for a Finger object
 * using an ID from an earlier frame when no Finger objects with that ID
 * exist in the current frame. A Finger object created from the Finger
 * constructor is also invalid.<br/>
 * Test for validity with the <code>Finger.sValid()</code> function.
