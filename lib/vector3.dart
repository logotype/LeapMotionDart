/**
 * The Vector class represents a three-component mathematical vector
 * or point such as a direction or position in three-dimensional space.
 *
 * The Leap Motion software employs a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.
 * Values given are in units of real-world millimeters. The origin is
 * centered at the center of the Leap Motion Controller. The x- and z-axes lie in
 * the horizontal plane, with the x-axis running parallel to the long edge
 * of the device. The y-axis is vertical, with positive values increasing
 * upwards (in contrast to the downward orientation of most computer
 * graphics coordinate systems). The z-axis has positive values increasing
 * away from the computer screen.
