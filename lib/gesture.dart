/**
 * The Gesture class represents a recognized movement by the user.
 *
 * The Leap Motion watches the activity within its field of view for certain movement
 * patterns typical of a user gesture or command. For example, a movement from
 * side to side with the hand can indicate a swipe gesture, while a finger poking
 * forward can indicate a screen tap gesture.
 *
 * When the Leap Motion recognizes a gesture, it assigns an ID and adds a Gesture object
 * to the frame gesture list. For continuous gestures, which occur over many frames,
 * the Leap Motion updates the gesture by adding a Gesture object having the same ID and
 * updated properties in each subsequent frame.
 *
 * <strong>Important: Recognition for each type of gesture must be enabled using the
 * <code>Controller.enableGesture()</code> function; otherwise no gestures are recognized
 * or reported.</strong>
 *
 * Subclasses of Gesture define the properties for the specific movement
 * patterns recognized by the Leap Motion.
 *
 * The Gesture subclasses for include:
 * <pre>
 * CircleGesture – A circular movement by a finger.
 * SwipeGesture – A straight line movement by the hand with fingers extended.
 * ScreenTapGesture – A forward tapping movement by a finger.
 * KeyTapGesture – A downward tapping movement by a finger.
 * </pre>
 * 
 *
 * Circle and swipe gestures are continuous and these objects can have a state
 * of start, update, and stop.
 *
 * The screen tap gesture is a discrete gesture. The Leap Motion only creates a single
 * ScreenTapGesture object appears for each tap and it always has a stop state.
 *
 * Get valid Gesture instances from a Frame object. You can get a list of gestures
 * with the <code>Frame.gestures()</code> method. You can get a list of gestures since a specified
 * frame with the <code>Frame.gestures(frame)</code> methods. You can also use the <code>Frame.gesture()</code>
 * method to find a gesture in the current frame using an ID value obtained
 * in a previous frame.
 *
 * Gesture objects can be invalid. For example, when you get a gesture by ID using
 * <code>Frame.gesture()</code>, and there is no gesture with that ID in the current frame, then
 * <code>gesture()</code> returns an Invalid Gesture object (rather than a null value).
 * Always check object validity in situations where a gesture might be invalid.
 *
 * The following keys can be used with the Config class to configure the gesture recognizer:
